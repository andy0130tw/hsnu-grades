# HSNU Grades
The frontend of HSNU modern score querying system.

# Origin
In October 2014, I started this project to replace the [old and shabby score querying system](http://grades.hs.ntnu.edu.tw/online/). IE-only and mobile-unfriendly website should not survive in the world ANYMORE. To put the idea into practice, I built a modern, mobile-friendly score querying system.

Soon, a month after (November 2014), the admin of the official school website [stole my idea](http://140.131.149.30/login). This issue must be mentioned.

# Used libraries
  * jQuery
  * Bootstrap
  * Backbone - Rather too primitive. I was reinventing the wheel.
    * Underscore
  * HTML5Shiv
  * Respond.js - These are for browser compatibility.
